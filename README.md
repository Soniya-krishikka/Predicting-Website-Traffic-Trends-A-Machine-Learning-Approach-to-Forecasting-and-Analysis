# Predicting-Website-Traffic-Trends-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Forecasting-and-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to forecast website traffic using the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model. The dataset consists of daily traffic views from "Thecleverprogrammer.com" and is used to predict future traffic trends. The key steps include data preprocessing, seasonal decomposition, model training, and prediction visualization.

## Key Components

- **Data Preprocessing**: Converts the 'Date' column to datetime format and visualizes daily traffic patterns.
- **Seasonal Decomposition**: Analyzes the data to understand its seasonal and trend components.
- **SARIMA Modeling**: Trains a Seasonal ARIMA model to forecast future traffic.
- **Prediction and Visualization**: Generates and plots future traffic predictions.

## Dependencies

- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `plotly`
- `statsmodels`

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soniya-krishikka/Predicting-Website-Traffic-Trends-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Forecasting-and-Analysis.git
   cd website-traffic-forecasting
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have all required packages installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib plotly statsmodels
   ```


## Results

The SARIMA model forecasts traffic for the next 50 days with visualizations to compare predicted values against historical data.
